      # However, if I exclude apps/rag here, then general backend changes won't be tested against rag?
      # Wait, user said "Dedicated Nested CI... Update ci.yml to also trigger on changes to backend/apps/rag to ensure overall backend integrity."
      # So I should NOT exclude apps/rag here. But I MUST exclude frontend.
